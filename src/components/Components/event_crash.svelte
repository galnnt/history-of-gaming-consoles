  export let description = `In 1983, a large-scale recession happened in the 
  gaming console industry, known as the Videogame Crash of 1983. It happened 
  mostly in the US, when too many games were released in the market in 1982. 
  This caused many stores to have insufficient space for storing the games and 
  the consoles themselves. As they tried to ask for refunds from the game 
  producers, the publishers neither have cash nor new products for any refunds. 
  This led to prices of games dropping dramatically. On top of that, people 
  began preferring rushed games which are cheaper, rather than the more 
  expensive games of high quality. The crash shrunk the console market by a lot, 
  resulting in Magnavox exiting the industry, and Atari losing large amounts of 
  money.`;
